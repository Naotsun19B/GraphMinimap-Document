## Description

This plugin adds a minimap to the graph editor that gives you an overview of the entire graph.  
You can also operate the graph editor from the minimap.  

## Requirement

Target version : UE4.27 ï½ž 5.6    
Target platform : Windows, Mac, Linux  

## Installation

Install from the [marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en/product/graph-minimap).  
If the feature is not available after installing the plugin, it is possible that the plugin has not been enabled, so please check if the plugin is enabled from Edit > Plugins.

## Features And Usages

It supports basic graph editors such as blueprint and material, etc.  
The minimap is automatically displayed when you open the graph editor.  
You can switch the minimap mode with the shortcut key.  
The default shortcut key is ```Ctrl + M```.  
The minimap mode and size are saved for each graph and will be restored the next time you open the graph editor.  

### Hidden

The minimap is hidden.  

### Resizable

You can resize the minimap by dragging.  
You can change the drawing scale of the minimap by scrolling the mouse.  

### Visible

There is no collision detection on the minimap, and you can operate the graph editor through the minimap.  

### Controllable

You can move the camera position of the graph editor by dragging.  
You can zoom with the mouse scroll.  

### Minimap Area

In addition to displaying the entire graph, there is a function that allows you to display each comment in the graph on the minimap so that you can use the minimap even when working with huge graphs.  
You can switch the display area of the minimap with the shortcut key or the combo box on the minimap.  
The default shortcut key is ```Ctrl + N```.  
The selected display area is saved for each graph and restored the next time the graph editor is opened.  

### Stream Deck

![StreamDeckApplication](https://github.com/Naotsun19B/GraphMinimap-Document/assets/51815450/a8abe4ca-9b4c-4ca2-a45b-854aec65f59c)

This plugin supports calling functions from Stream Deck.

Follow the steps below to use the feature:

1. Install the Graph Minimap plugin for the Stream Deck from the `Graph Minimap - Stream Deck` in the editor preferences, then `Install Stream Deck Plugin`.
2. Place buttons for the functions you want to use in the Stream Deck application.
3. Set the `Http Path` and `Port Number` properties of the placed button. (You can leave it as default)
4. Set the `Http Path` and `Port Number` of `Graph Minimap - Remote Control` in the editor preferences to the same values as those on the Stream Deck side. (You can leave it as default)
5. You can connect to the Stream Deck by setting `Enable Remote Control` in `Graph Minimap - Remote Control` in the editor preferences to `true`.
6. Press the button placed from the Stream Deck.
